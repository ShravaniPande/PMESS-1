# Preventive Maintenance Enterprise Software Solution (PMESS)
Our project proposes to implement an automated ‘Preventive Maintenance Enterprise Software Solution’ that is customized specifically to the needs and requirements of one of the company. The proposed application would offer core functionalities like infrastructure equipment monitoring and scheduling service checks based on two parameters, namely, time and usage. Since it is a computerized application and can be accessed from anywhere, iteliminates the need to move documents with the correct equipment between facilities, thereby, reducing maintenance errors. The mechanics and managers can simply log in to the system with their respective credentials and have access to the required information instantly. This cuts down on the information retrieval time significantly as there is no need to search multiple binders for the required information. The backup of the data in the cloud makes our proposed system reliable and fault tolerant as data can be retrieved even if it is lost due to technical system failures. Majority of the end users of our application are mechanics with limited knowledge of operating computers. Therefore, minimalistic design and core usability features would be important aspects of our application which aim to address the pain points of the end user.
